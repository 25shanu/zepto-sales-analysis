Zepto Sales Analysis (Python + SQL)

1. Project Overview

This project is a Sales Analysis for Zepto, designed to derive meaningful business insights from raw sales, inventory, delivery, and returns data.
The analysis was performed using SQL for querying and Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly) for data visualization.

The goal of this project is to connect theory with real-world datasets and uncover patterns in sales, store performance, customer behavior, and delivery efficiency.

2. Dataset Description

The project uses six tables:
darkwarehouse → Store details (capacity, location).
orders → Customer orders (order date, status, amounts, delivery times).
products → Product details (category, brand, price).
inventory → Stock details (stock quantity, reorder level).
delivery → Delivery partner info, distances, timings.
returns → Returned products (reasons, refund amount, status).

3. Key Questions Answered

a. Sales & Revenue
b. Store Performance
c. Delivery Insights
d. Inventory Insights
e. Returns Analysis

4. Visualizations

The analysis includes 10+ visualizations created using Python libraries:
Pandas & NumPy → For data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn → Bar charts, line plots, histograms, scatter plots.

Some key visuals:
Day-wise sales trend
Revenue by category/brand/store
On-time vs late deliveries (donut chart)
Delivery distance distribution (histogram)
Top 5 most returned products

5. Tools & Techniques Used

SQL → Joins, CTEs, Subqueries, Window Functions, Aggregations.
Python → Pandas, NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation.
Visualization → Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Jupyter Notebook → For analysis and presentation.

6. Business Insights & Conclusion

Beverages & Snacks dominate sales revenue.
Some stores achieve higher revenue per capacity, highlighting efficiency gaps.
On-time delivery performance varies by partner → opportunities for improvement.
Certain categories (e.g., Snacks) show higher return rates, indicating quality or demand issues.
Inventory restocking is crucial in fast-moving categories to avoid stockouts.

7. Acknowledgment

This project was built independently to strengthen SQL + Python data analysis skills.
Working on real-world datasets helped me connect theory with practical business problems.
